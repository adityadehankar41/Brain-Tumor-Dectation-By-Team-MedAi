# Brain-Tumor-Dectation-By-Team-MedAi
This project is based on how a ML can detect the tumor present in brain on the basis of MRI scann and give the report on the basis of it.
# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning (CNN)

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect the presence of a brain tumor from MRI images.  
The model is trained on MRI datasets and achieves high accuracy in classification.
